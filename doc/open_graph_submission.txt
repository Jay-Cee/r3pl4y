My last publish was very premature and unplanned. I hope this one will meet your standards.

R3PL4Y.com is a website under development where you as a user should be able to review games in your collection to keep track of games played and what you thought of them. You will see statistics over your reviews and get suggestions of games you might enjoy.

R3PL4Y.com is currently under ALPHA stage in development, and we're looking forward to a BETA release 15 May 2012. That is when we will start inviting users to test our functionality.
